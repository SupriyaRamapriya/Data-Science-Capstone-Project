Building A Predictive Text Algorithm
========================================================

Our goal was to create an algorithm for predicting the next word given one or more words as input. A large corpus of more than 4 million documents was loaded and analyzed. N-grams were extracted from the corpus and then used for building the predictive model. Various methods of improving the prediction accuracy and speed were explored.

Designing And Improving The Algorithm
========================================================

- N-gram model with back-off strategy was used
- Dataset was cleaned, lower-cased, removing links, twitter handles, punctuations, numbers and extra whitespaces, etc
- Matrices from 6-gram to uni-gram were extracted
- Sorted N-grams by frequency of occurrence
- Reduced size of model by dropping least frequent N-grams
- Further optimized speed and memory by dropping least frequent 2-grams and 1-grams since very large matrices of 2-grams and 1-grams do not appear to improve accuracy

Predictive Algorithm Shiny App
========================================================

- Provides a text input box for user to type a phrase
- Detects words typed and predicts the next word reactively
- Iterates from longest N-gram (6-gram) to shortest (2-gram)
- Uses last word in matching N-gram as predicted word
- Predicts using the longest, most frequent, matching N-gram
- If no match is found using 6-, 5-, 4-, 3- and 2-grams, randomly selects most frequent word (1-gram)
- Allows to configure how many words the app should suggest

Application Performance
========================================================
- Final model size:
    - <small>82,672 6-grams with frequency > 2</small>
    - <small>184,171 5-grams with frequency > 2</small>
    - <small>474,914 4-grams with frequency > 2</small>
    - <small>440,851 3-grams with frequency > 3</small>
    - <small>About 200k 2-grams and about 20k words (1-grams)</small>
- Average response time under 2 seconds
- Application memory usage under 250MB
