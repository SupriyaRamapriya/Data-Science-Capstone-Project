This application is developed as part of the requirement for the Coursera Data Science Capstone Course. The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.

## Results

1. Next word predicted is shown at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. Information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is shown as indication.

## Note:

The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the GitHub repo

Presentation Slide decks are available on the RPubs page
